Greetings! My name is Jamie and I'm an Associate Professor in Graduate Psychology and the Director of the MS in Clinical Psychology Program at [California Lutheran University](https://www.callutheran.edu/faculty/profile.html?id=jbedics). I have been at Cal Lutheran since 2010. 

At CLU, I mostly teach courses in my clinical area of expertise called [dialectical behavior therapy](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/psyd-clinical-psychology/dbt.html) and I am the director of the DBT Training Clinic at [the CLU Community Counseling Centers](http://www.clucounseling.org/services/dbt.html).  When I can, I like to do a little research mostly in the area of suicide intervention and psychotherapy.  The majority of my time is spent on curriculum development of the MS program to improve the future of researchers in psychology by teaching the values and ethics associated with open science, reproducibility, and transparency in science. 

I am also Clinical Instructor at the University of California, Los Angeles in the  [Youth Stress and Mood Program (YSAM)](http://www2.semel.ucla.edu/youth-stress) directed by Dr. Joan Asarnow. In this position I have provided support to two large grants awarded to Dr. Asarnow and her collaborators including Dr. Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington. The research and clinical work at YSAM is focused on the treatment of adolescents and families that struggle with depression and suicidal behavior.

When I'm not working, I like to run around my neighborhood in Venice, CA.  I, off and on, study Japanese and spend a lot of time traveling including to Japan and my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.
