Greetings! My name is Jamie and I'm an Associate Professor in Graduate Psychology and the Director of the MS in Clinical Psychology Program at [California Lutheran University](https://www.callutheran.edu/faculty/profile.html?id=jbedics). I have been at Cal Lutheran since 2010. I'm originally from Bethlehem, PA and attended Penn State University for my Bachelors degree.  After Penn State, I left to study at the University of Utah and earned a Masters of Science in Clinical Psychology.  Undecided on my future, I joined [AmeriCorps](https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps) where I worked in St. Petersburg, FL at Catholic Charities as a mental health counselor to a low-income community.  I also worked in refugee resettlement where I helped families form Aghanistan and Bosnia resettle in the US.  After deciding to pursue my PhD, I attend Fuller Graduate School where I received by PHD and a masters degree in theology. During my doctoral work, I completed an internship at the Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, OR.  After internship, I completed a two-year fellowship in dialectical behavior therapy where I had the fortune to work closely with the treatment developer of DBT, Dr. Marsha Linehan.   

At CLU, I mostly teach courses in my clinical area of expertise called [dialectical behavior therapy](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/psyd-clinical-psychology/dbt.html) and I am the director of the DBT Training Clinic at [the CLU Community Counseling Centers](http://www.clucounseling.org/services/dbt.html).  When I can, I like to do a little research mostly in the area of suicide intervention and psychotherapy.  The majority of my time is spent on curriculum development of the MS program to improve the future of researchers in psychology by teaching the values and ethics associated with open science, reproducibility, and transparency in science. 

I am also Clinical Instructor at the University of California, Los Angeles in the  [Youth Stress and Mood Program (YSAM)](http://www2.semel.ucla.edu/youth-stress) directed by Dr. Joan Asarnow. In this position I have provided support to two large grants awarded to Dr. Asarnow and her collaborators including Dr. Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington. The research and clinical work at YSAM is focused on the treatment of adolescents and families that struggle with depression and suicidal behavior.

When I'm not working, I like to run around my neighborhood in Venice, CA.  I, off and on, study Japanese and spend a lot of time traveling including to Japan.
