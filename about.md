Greetings! My name is Jamie and I'm an [Associate Professor in Graduate Psychology](https://www.callutheran.edu/faculty/profile.html?id=jbedics) at California Lutheran University. I am also the Director of the [MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP)](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/ms-clinical-psychology/) at CLU. I have been at Cal Lutheran since 2010. 

At CLU, I mostly teach courses in my clinical area of expertise called [dialectical behavior therapy](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/psyd-clinical-psychology/dbt.html).  I am also the director of the DBT Training Clinic at the [CLU Community Counseling Centers](http://www.clucounseling.org/services/dbt.html). When I can, I like to do a little research mostly in the area of suicide intervention and psychotherapy. The majority of my time is spent on curriculum development for the MSCP program where we emphasize the values of openness, transparency, and collaboration in our research.  We seek to accomplish this through the use of the R statistical programming to help ensure reproducible data analysis, version control technology for collaboration, and pre-registration of all empirical studies.

In addition to my duties at CLU, I am a Clinical Instructor at UCLA in the [Youth Stress and Mood Program (YSAM)](http://www2.semel.ucla.edu/youth-stress) directed by Dr. Joan Asarnow. In this position I have worked on two large grants awarded to Dr. Asarnow and her collaborators including Dr. Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington. The research and clinical work at YSAM is focused on the treatment of adolescents and families that struggle with depression and suicidal behavior.

When I'm not working, I like to run around my neighborhood in Venice, CA.  I, off and on again, study Japanese and spend a lot of time traveling including to Japan and my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.  

Please feel free to contact me.  If you wish to schedule appointment you must do so a week in advance using the calendar link below or on the sidebar.
