Welcome to Dr. Bedics' Statistics and Research Methods Resource Site for the **MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP)** at California Lutheran University (CLU), Thousand Oaks, CA. 

The CLU MSCP is a two-year program that balances training in evidence-based clinical psychology wtih advanced training in statistical methods.  This website is meant to supplement the portion of the program devoted to *statistical and quantitative methods*.  

*****

## Scientific Values *Matter*

Statistical and quantitative training in the CLU MSCP program emphasizes open science and reproducibility in psychological science.  The values of open science include principles such as:
+ Collaboration
+ Transparency
+ Openness
+ Reproducibility
+ Integrity

These norms counter the arguably dominant cultural norms in psychology of competitiveness, secrecy, and evaluation of peers' work based on reputation and quantity over quality.

## Advanced Technology for Quantitative Methods 

In addition to the values associated with open science, students are taught *how* to best utilize the latest technologies as a method of fulfilling these values.

The program is committed to the use of the [R language for statistical programming](https://www.r-project.org/) and the use of [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the primary interface for working with R.  All R software used in this program is free. Along with the increasing popularity of [R](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), R surpasses the functionality and capability of commercial software in a myriad of ways.  In addition to R, we use the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/institutions/callutheran/) at CLU for the management and sharing of our research projects.<br/>

## MSCP Curriculum in Development

 In the first year, students coursework provides them with an introduction to the use of R in basic statistical computing and research methods. The MSCP program is making the following proposed changes that have yet to be approved by faculty. Please see the [official CLU webpage](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/ms-clinical-psychology/curriculum.html) for the approved course curriculum.  

### Year One 

| Semester	|  Course Name	| 
|:---:	|:---	| 
| Fall | Advanced Statistics I: Linear Regression (PSYC562)  | 
| Fall | Psychopathology (MFT; PSYC510) or *Exploratory Data Analysis (not yet offered)* |
| Fall | Counseling (MFT; PSYC512) or *Exploratory Data Analysis (not yet offered)* |
| Spring |Survey of Psychological Testing (PSYC550) or *Psychometric Theory (not yet offered)* | 
| Spring | Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interviewing (PSYC530) or *Program Evaluation (not yet offered)* |
| Spring | Advanced Research Methods (PSYC 564)	|
| Summer |  Law & Ethics (MFT; PSYC530) or *Research Ethics (not yet offered)*	|
| Summer | DBT Skills Training (PSYC 501)	|

### Year Two

In the second year, students continue to tailor the program to fit their needs. Students select a two-course (Fall and Spring) sequence of electives that have either a **Quantitative Methods (QM)** or **Clinical Science (CS)** emphasis.

Students also have the option of conducting their own research project during the thesis seminar (PSYC 565).  In the thesis seminar, students can complete an independent, IRB approved, research project for a thesis.  Thesis students will take additional thesis units in the Spring.  

Students taking PSYC 565 do not, however, have to complete the thesis but can use the thesis seminar to prepare a research project for future doctoral work (research project option).  These students will be required to take the comprehensive exams in the Spring of their second year.  


| Semester  | Course Type | | Course Name
|:---:	|:----: | :----: | :---- |
| Fall | Core Course | | ABA (PSYC532) or *Advanced Statistics II: Hierarchical Linear Models (not yet offered)* |
| Fall | Elective | **Specialization Part I** | Choose One[^fall] |
| Fall | Optional | | Thesis Seminar  | 
| Spring | Elective | **Specialization Part II** | Choose One[^spring] |
| Spring | Elective | Comps Only | Select with Program Director  | 
| Spring | Optional | | Thesis Units  |
| Spring | Optional | | Comprehensive Exam/Elective  |

*****

[^fall]: Fall Course Options (subject to change) include DBT Basics, ACT, Quantitative Methods (TBD), or MFT course options (e.g., trauma, child/adolescent, family mediation)
[^spring]: Spring Course Options (subject to change) include Suicide Assessment and Risk Management (Part II for DBT and ACT), Quantitative Methods II (TBD), or part II of the same MFT course options.
