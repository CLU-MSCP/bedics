Welcome to Dr. Bedics' Statistics and Research Methods Resource Site for the **MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP)** at California Lutheran University (CLU), Thousand Oaks, CA. 

The CLU MSCP is a two-year program that balances training in evidence-based clinical psychology wtih advanced training in statistical methods.  This website is meant to supplement the portion of the program devoted to *statistical and quantitative methods*.  

Statistical and quantitative training in the CLU MSCP program emphasizes open science and reproducibility in psychological science.  The values of open science include principles such as:
+ Collaboration
+ Transparency
+ Openness
+ Reproducibility
+ Integrity

These norms counter the arguably dominant cultural norms in psychology of competitiveness, secrecy, and evaluation of peers' work based on reputation and quantity over quality.  

In addition to the values associated with open science, students are taught *how* to best utilize the latest technologies as a method of fulfilling these values.

The program is committed to the use of the [R language for statistical programming](https://www.r-project.org/) and the use of [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the primary interface for working with R.  All R software used in this program is free. Along with the increasing popularity of [R](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), R surpasses the functionality and capability of commercial software in a myriad of ways.  In addition to R, we use the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/institutions/callutheran/) at CLU for the management and sharing of our research projects.<br/>

# Tentative MSCP Curriculum in Development

The MSCP program is making the following proposed changes that have yet to be approved by faculty.  In the first year, students take courses that provide them with a firm foundation in statistical computing, use of R, experimental methods and also ethics in the conduct of research in psychology and the social and behavioral sciences. Please see the [official CLU webpage](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/ms-clinical-psychology/curriculum.html) for the approved course curriculum.  

## Year One 

| Semester	|  Course Name	| 
|:---:	|:---	| 
| Fall | Advanced Statistics I: Linear Regression (PSYC562)  | 
| Fall | Psychopathology (MFT; PSYC510) or *Exploratory Data Analysis (not yet offered)* |
| Fall | Counseling (MFT; PSYC512) or *Exploratory Data Analysis (not yet offered)* |
| Spring |Survey of Psychological Testing (PSYC550) or *Psychometric Theory (not yet offered)* | 
| Spring | Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interviewing (PSYC530) or *Program Evaluation (not yet offered)* |
| Spring | Advanced Research Methods (PSYC 564)	|
| Summer |  Law & Ethics (MFT; PSYC530) or *Research Ethics (not yet offered)*	|
| Summer | DBT Skills Training (PSYC 501)	|

## Year Two

In the second year, students continue to tailor the program to fit their needs. Students select a two-course (Fall and Spring) sequence of electives that have either a **Quantitative Methods (QM)** or **Clinical Science (CS)** emphasis.

Students also have the option of conducting their own research project during the thesis seminar (PSYC 565).  In the thesis seminar, students can complete an independent, IRB approved, research project for a thesis.  Thesis students will take additional thesis units in the Spring.  

Students taking PSYC 565 do not, however, have to complete the thesis but can use the thesis seminar to prepare a research project for future doctoral work (research project option).  These students will be required to take the comprehensive exams in the Spring of their second year.  


| Semester  | Course Type | | Course Name
|:---:	|:----: | :----: | :---- |
| Fall | Core Course | | ABA (PSYC532) or *Advanced Statistics II: Hierarchical Linear Models (not yet offered)* |
| Fall | Elective | **Specialization Part I** | Choose One[^fall] |
| Fall | Optional | | Thesis Seminar  | 
| Spring | Elective | **Specialization Part II** | Choose One[^spring] |
| Spring | Elective | Comps Only | Select with Program Director  | 
| Spring | Optional | | Thesis Units  |
| Spring | Optional | | Comprehensive Exam/Elective  |

# Professional Development Resources

Below are a list of resources for your own professional developmment.  There is a fun and lively group of researchers and statisticians on various social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook. You are encouraged to engage this community for both knowledge and inspiration.

## Professional Organizations and Conferences

**Join and Present your Work Here**

1. [Association for Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/) has been at the forefront of the open science movement.  I strongly encourage you become a student member and consider submitting to their [conference](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions) to present your work. The APS annual conference is typically at the end May with deadlines to submit in January. [Graduate student affiliation](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/members/membership-categories) is about $80. 

2. [Western Psychological Association](https://westernpsych.org/) is our regional group where you can freely present your research findings to a *very, very* friendly and welcoming group of people. [WPA's annual convention](https://westernpsych.org/convention/) is held at the end of April. The poster sessions are, however, sometimes sparcely attended and not very active in giving you feedback.  WPA is a good *first* conference. Submission deadline is usually in November or December. [Membership](https://westernpsych.org/members-login-or-join/) is free for one-year.    
 
**Attend, Learn, and Participate**

1. [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/) is a conference where open science *is* the topic of conversation.  It's not your typical conference.  At SIPS you are encouraged to join working groups, mingle, and actively participate in projects that further the advancement of psychological science. 

2. [R Studio Conference](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) is *quite* spendy for both registration and pre-conference workshops.  However, you'll learn from the best and brightest from R Studio covering topics from machine learning to data wrangling in R with R Studio.

3. [Use R!](https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html) was recently in [Brisbane, Australia (2018)](https://user2018.r-project.org/) and will be in [Toulouse, France in 2019!](http://www.user2019.fr/). Check out the 2018 site for topics covered.

## Blogs

1. [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/) certainly does not sound like the most interesting blog to read.  However, Andrew Gelman's sass and irreverance make him the **#1** [*methodological terrorist*](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/09/21/what-has-happened-down-here-is-the-winds-have-changed/) that will keep you reading.  You'll also learn a lot about statistics and, specifically, Bayesian modeling.

2. [Data Colada](http://datacolada.org/") will make all your false-positive and asterisk/significance chasing dreams come crashing down to terra firma. It will also simply make you a better researcher.

3. [The 20% Statistician](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/") is by the author of my favorite [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) course that should be required watching for all of humanity.

## Podcasts

Podcasts can be very motivating and fun.  It's nice to hear people talk about the things you learn in the classroom.  It's especially helpful when the podcasts creators are fun, genuine, and down-to-earth.  There are many data science and reproducibility podcasts but the following are my favorite:

1. [Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) is fun and light but with enough content to get you excited about the world of statistics and data science.  

2. [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/") is no longer in production but you can't go wrong listening to folks drink their beer and talk about data, R, and statistics.  I'm fond of this [episode](http://partiallyderivative.com/news/2015/01/09/episode-9-the-one-that-will-totally-change-your-life) from season one. I also love Chris Albon's [flashcards](https://twitter.com/chrisalbon); a great way to learn. 

3. [DataFramed](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast) is a blog on data analysis and data science from the folks at DataCamp.  The podcast can be fairly technical but can be very informative and help you think out of the psychology box.
