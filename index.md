Welcome to Dr. Bedics' Statistics and Research Methods Resource Site for the **MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP)** at California Lutheran University (CLU), Thousand Oaks, CA. 

The CLU MSCP is a two-year program that balances training in evidence-based clinical psychology with advanced training in statistical methods.  This website is meant to supplement the portion of the program devoted to *statistical and quantitative methods*.  

*****

## Scientific Values *Matter*

Statistical and quantitative training in the CLU MSCP program emphasizes open science and reproducibility in psychological science.  The values of open science include principles such as:
+ Collaboration
+ Transparency
+ Openness
+ Reproducibility
+ Integrity

These norms counter the arguably dominant cultural norms in psychology of competitiveness, secrecy, and evaluation of peers' work based on reputation and quantity over quality.

## Advanced Technology for Quantitative Methods 

In addition to the values associated with open science, students are taught *how* to best utilize the latest technologies as a method of fulfilling these values.

The program is committed to the use of the [R language for statistical programming](https://www.r-project.org/) and the use of [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the primary interface for working with R.  All R software used in this program is free. Along with the increasing popularity of [R](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), R surpasses the functionality and capability of commercial software in a myriad of ways.  In addition to R, we use the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/institutions/callutheran/) at CLU for the management and sharing of our research projects.<br/>

## MSCP Curriculum in Development

 In the first year, students coursework provides them with an introduction to the use of R in basic statistical computing and research methods. The MSCP program is making the following proposed changes that have yet to be approved by faculty. Please see the [official CLU webpage](https://www.callutheran.edu/academics/graduate/ms-clinical-psychology/curriculum.html) for the approved course curriculum.
