Welcome to Dr. Bedics' Statistics and Research Methods Resource Site for the **MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP)** at California Lutheran University (CLU), Thousand Oaks, CA. 

The CLU MSCP is a two-year program that balances training in evidence-based clinical psychology wtih advanced training in statistical methods.  This website is meant to supplement the portion of the program devoted to *statistical and quantitative methods*.  

Statistical and quantitative training in the CLU MSCP program emphasizes open science and reproducibility in psychological science.  The values of open science include such principles of collaboration, transparency, openness, reproducibility, and integrity.  These norms counter the arguably dominant culture of competitiveness, secrecy, and evaluation of peers' work based on reputation and quantity over quality.  In addition to the values associated with open science, students are taught how to best utilize the latest technologies as a method of fulfilling these values.

The program is committed to the use of the [R language for statistical programming](https://www.r-project.org/) and the use of [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the primary interface for working with R.  All R software used in this program is free. Along with the increasing popularity of [R](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), R surpasses the functionality and capability of commercial software in a myriad of ways.<br/>

->Tentative MSCP Curriculum Proposal<-

In the first year, students take courses that provide them with a firm foundation in statistical computing, use of R, experimental methods and also ethics in the conduct of research in psychology and the social and behavioral sciences.  

#### Year One 

| Semester	|  Course Name	| 
|:---:	|:---	| 
| Fall | Advanced Statistics I: Linear Regression  | 
| Fall | Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Wrangling and Visualization in R |
| Fall | Psychopathology or Counseling|
| Spring | Psychometrics & Test Development | 
| Spring | Program Evaluation & Clinical Trials or Clinical Option |
| Spring | Experimental Methods	|

<br>

#### Year Two

In the second year, students are able to tailor the program to fit their needs in two ways.  First, students can select one of two electives with either a **Quantitative Methods (QM)** or **Clinical Science (CS)** emphasis.  Second, students have the option of conducting their own research project during the thesis seminar.  In the thesis seminar, students can complete an independent, IRB approved, research project or develop a research project most similar to a program evaluation. 



| Semester  | Course Type | | Course Name
|:---:	|:----: | :----: | :---- |
| Fall | Core Course | |Advanced Statistics II: Hierarchical Linear Models  |
| Fall | **Specialization 1** | `QM` | TBD |
| Fall | **Specialization 2** | `CS` | Introduction to DBT or ACT |
| Fall | Optional | | Thesis Seminar or Final Research Project  | 
| Spring | **Specialization 1** | `QM` | TBD |
| Spring | **Specialization 2** | `CS` | Suicide Risk Assessment and Management |
| Spring | Elective | Comps Only | Select with Program Director  | 
| Spring | Optional | | Thesis Units  |
| Spring | Optional | | Comprehensive Exam/Elective  |

A benefit of using R to answer your questions is the lively and active community of researchers that share their thoughts and advice on various social media platforms.

#### Professional Organizations and Conferences

Join and Present your Work Here

1. [Association for Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/) has been at the forefront of the open science movement.  I strongly encourage you to become a student member and consider submitting to their [conference](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions) to present your work. The APS annual conference is typically at the end May with deadlines to submit in January. [Graduate student affiliation](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/members/membership-categories) is about $80. [Western Psychological Association](https://westernpsych.org/) is our regional group where you can freely present your research findings to a *very, very* friendly and welcoming group of people.  

[WPA's annual convention](https://westernpsych.org/convention/) is held at the end of April and the best place to present your work for the first time.  The poster sessions are, however, sometimes spracely attended and not very active.  [Membership](https://westernpsych.org/members-login-or-join/) is free for one-year.  I recommend going here to present your work. Submission deadline is usually in November or December.  
 
**Attend, Learn, and Participate**

[Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/) is a conference where ideas around open science are the topic of conversation.  Not your typical conference, at SIPS you are encouraged to join working groups, mingle, and actively participate in projects that further improved psychological science. 

[R Studio Conference](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) is *quite* spendy for both registration and pre-conference workshops.  However, you'll learn from the best and brightest from R Studio covering topics from machine learning to data wrangling in R with R Studio.

[Use R!](https://www.r-project.org/conferences.html) was recently in [Brisbane, Australia](https://user2018.r-project.org/) and will be in [Toulouse, France in 2019!](http://www.user2019.fr/). Check out the 2018 site for topics covered.

->**Blogs**<-

[Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/) certainly does not sound like the most interesting blog.  However, Andrew Gelman's sass and irreverance make him the #1 [*methodological terrorist*](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/09/21/what-has-happened-down-here-is-the-winds-have-changed/) that you should be reading. 

[Data Colada](http://datacolada.org/") will make all your false-positive, significance star chasing dreams coming crashing down to terra firma. 

[The 20% Statistician](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/") is by the author of my favorite [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) that is required watching for anyone serioius about statistics. 


->**Podcasts**<-

I found podcasts very motivational especially of the creators are down to earth and fun.  I found two that count and they're listed below.  

[Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) is fun, light but with enough content to get you excited about the world of statistics and data science.  

[Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/") is no longer in production but you can't go wrong listening to folks drink their beer and talk about data, R, and statistics.  I'm found of this [episode](http://partiallyderivative.com/news/2015/01/09/episode-9-the-one-that-will-totally-change-your-life) from season one. I love Chris Albon's [flashcards](https://twitter.com/chrisalbon)


->**Open Data is the Best Data**<-

You don't have to collect data from 90 college undegrads to answer your questions.  There might be an open data set that will help answer a question important to you.

[Data World](https://data.world/), [Data.Gov](https://www.data.gov/), [Datasets in R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html), [ROpenSci]("https://ropensci.org/packages/), [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/">Data Science for Social Good), [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/), [Data Quest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/), [City of New York](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/), [ICSPR at Blue](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/), [Data Science Central](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/great-github-list-of-public-data-sets), [538 at Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data") or anything at GitHub really, [ProPublica Data Store](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/), [GSS Data](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
