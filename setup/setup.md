## R and R Studio {#rsetup}

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is the statistical programming language that forms the foundation of everything we do in class. For those interested, Roger Peng provides a nice [Overview and History of R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STihTnVSZnI).  [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is how we work with R. R is run *through* R Studio.  R Studio simply adds a lot more functionality and is also more aesthetically pleasing.  You need *both* R and R Studio and to update them seperately. 

You can find specific instructions on how to setup up R and R Studio [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/r-and-r-studio-setup). 


## Open Science Framerwork {#osf}

Open Science Framework or [OSF](https://osf.io/) provides strucure and support in organizing your research projects in the cloud. Benefits of OSF including the following:

* Keep all your materials, data, and code in one **central storage repository**.
* Make your OSF Project **private or public**. You can make your project public to show-off **how** you conduct research that is hidden in simply citations of work.
* Easily **collaborate** with peers and instructors.  
* OSF also allows for **version control** so you can work with a single file name while maintaining a clear record of prior revisions.
* The use of OSF is consistent with values of open and transparent science. 
* OSF provides a mechanism for **[pre-registering](http://help.osf.io/m/registrations/l/524205-register-your-project)** your study.   

You can find specific instructions on how to setup up your OSF page [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/osf-setup-for-class-projects-or-theses). 

## Git and GitHub Setup {#git}

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) have a similar relationship as you've been between R and R Stduio.  Git is software for version control that is primarily utilized by computer programmers.  The basic idea is that you have a project and would like others to contribute (usually colleagues, instructors).  You can provide contributors with access to your code but maintain some control over what you allow to modify your core, source, code.  The benefit of Git is controlled collaboration allowing for the modication of files by multiple contributors.  A nice feature of Git is that old versions are *stored* and can be retrieved if you want to go back.  

<h4 align="center"><strong>Installing Git</strong></h4>
<p>
1. Mac: Go to <a  href="https://git-scm.com/">Git-SCM</a>.
2. Windows:  <a  href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">Git for Windows</a>.
3. Go through the motions for installation.
</p>
<h4 align="center"><strong>GitHub</strong></h4>
<p>
1. Get a Github account using your CLU email address at  <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  Please use a fairly recognizable handle (first initial last name or something)
2. Request your student developer pack at <a href="https://education.github.com/">Github Education</a>.
</p>

<h4 align="center"><strong>Extras</strong></h4>

<p>
1. Get a <a  href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/">Git Client</a>.  These are GUIs that provide some extra visualization for all your diffs, commits, etc.  I've tried a few but am not sold on any in particular. I would recommend trying the following and explore:</li>
    
    * GitKraken
    * SourceTree</p>

2. Here's a series of fun videos on Git and Github on Youtube by <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY">The Coding Train</a>.  You'll get a sense of effective workflow with Git and Github. I recommend watching all of these videos and taking notes.

## Slack Setup {#slack}

[Slack](https://slack.com/) stands for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge" but is basically a chat forum for people who like computer programming.  You can join "channels" or create your own group with others that creates a space for conversation about your "work". A major benefit of Slack is that it allows for the communication of code across a variety of computer and statistical programming languages. In that sense it's a bit more than other chat applications.
