## Doctoral Admission

These guidelines help me to help you in taking the next step in your career.  Please let me know if you need any accommodations to the below preferences.  

1. **Get Organized (Doctoral/Internship)** – The application process requires a great deal of organization. An ideal situation is for you to _share_ with me (not email me) a Google Sheet that lists all your schools, their deadlines, and whether or not you received a confirmation email that I submitted the letter of recommendation (LOR). I could then see what I’m missing. Here’s a doctoral example for a spreadsheet:

</center> 
 
You could add more information to share with me such as the admission ratio, average GREs for admission, or other tasks that help you keep track of what you need (i.e., submitted transcripts etc.). Revise this to fit your needs.

2. **Due Dates (Doctoral/Internship)** – You should submit all your LOR requests 1-month before each deadline. Anything less than 1-month is risky and so you should have your list early and resist the urge to make late additions.  

3. **Electronic Submissions (Doctoral)** – The best and easiest way for me to submit letters is through an online web portal that is sent to me via email from the university. Students can sometimes lack clarity on how to submit for each school. Please do your research. Related:

    a. **No Snail Mail** – I do not send enveloped mail to universities. Check to see if any of your schools require actual physical letters. You will need to provide me with a stamped, addressed envelope with no return address. Please discuss with me.
  
    b.	**LOR to Student** – I do not send letters directly for you to disperse at your choosing. That does not happen. You’ll have to drop the school or me. You pick. 

4. **Material (Doctoral/Internship)** – Feel free to share with me your personal statement, CVs, or other material on a Google Drive preferably where you shared your Google Sheet.  I provided example CVs and an excellent personal statement for doctoral programs in my MS Clinical Folder.
