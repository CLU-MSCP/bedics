### 1. Letters of Recommendation (LOR) {#lor}

  
**Get Organized (Doctoral/Internship)** – The application process requires a great deal of organization. An ideal situation is for you to _share_ with me (not email me) a Google Sheet that lists all your schools, their deadlines, and whether or not you received a confirmation email that I submitted the LOR. I could then see what I’m missing. Ultimately, it's your responsibility to keep track and not your recommender.  Here’s a doctoral example for a Google Sheet:

It is easier to use a Google Sheet than an imported Excel.  You could add more information to share with me such as the admission ratio, average GREs for admission, or other tasks that help you track what you need (i.e., submitted transcripts etc.). Revise this to fit your needs. The ideal situation is for you to have this **complete by 10/1**.  Late additions are risky and I would resist the urge to continually add programs.

**Due Dates (Doctoral/Internship)** – You should submit **all** your LOR requests 1-month prior to the earliest deadline. Anything less is risky. For example, if you have a 11/15 deadline then all your email requests should be sent to the recommender by 10/15.  This requires that you have your full list well in advance (10/1) and are able send out email requests early.

  * The latest for an email request to be sent to Dr. Bedics is 11/1.  If you miss this then Dr. Bedics cannot guarantee a timely submission.  

**Electronic Submissions (Doctoral)** – The best and easiest way for recommenders to submit letters is through an online web portal that is sent via email from the university. Students can sometimes lack clarity on how to submit for each school. Please do your research.

  * **Waive Your Rights** – You should waive your rights to read the letter.  Not doing so can be perceived as odd.  In the end, it is your choice. 
  
  * **Send all requests at once** – There can be nothing worse for a recommender than to receive random email requests to submit a letter for student.  What makes it worse, actually, is getting an email request with a due date less than a month.  The solution is to send the letter requests from all the university in one batch and at the same time. Such an approach is not only considerate of your recommender but will also increase the likelihood that no school will be missed.

  * **No Snail Mail** – I do not send enveloped mail to universities. Check to see if any of your schools require actual physical letters. You will need to provide me with a stamped, addressed envelope with no return address. Please discuss with me.
  
  * **LOR to Student** – I do not send letters directly to you for you to do what you want with them. That does not happen. You’ll have to drop the school or me. You pick.

**Thank You Cards** – A standard form of etiquette is to send a thank you letter.  Not an email but a physical card.  Your recommenders are likely old enough to appreciate a printed and written thank you card.  I would resist the urge to send gift cards (e.g., Starbucks cards).  The sentiment in the card is more than enough and you'll stand out.

### 2. Prospective Programs {#programs}

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of admission is to apply broadly across a number of criteria.  As noted above, typical criteria include:

  * Applicant/Acceptance Ratio
  * Average or Minimum GRE Scores
  * Average or Minimum GPA
  * Faculty Fit (PHD Programs)
  * School Mission Fit (PSYD Programs)  
  * Funding Available (Full or Partial Tuition Remission and/or Stipends)

Do what you can to quantify the above factors and fit them into your Excel. You can then do your best to assess the breadth of your options.  I would assign each school to one of three tiers (reach, middle, easy) based on your own personal sorting.  Lastly, make sure you have representation in all tiers.  In my experience, students either severely overestimate or underestimate themselves. Such a ranking can help see where you might have holes.

You should also consider programs outside of clinical psychology PHD or PSYD. Examine programs in the following areas:

  * Educational Psychology (w/ Quantitative Emphasis)
  * Counseling Psychology
  * Clinical Psychology PHD
  * PHD in Social Work or MFT
  * Public Health
  * Social, Developmental, Cognitive Psychology
  * Political Science

I recommend doing your best to include traditional universities and colleges rather than free-standing programs regardless of for-profit/non-for profit status.

### 3. Professional Material {#material}

Feel free to share with me your personal statement, CVs, or other material on a Google Drive preferably where you shared your Google Sheet.  I provided example CVs and an excellent personal statement for doctoral programs in the MS Clinical folder. You can access the folder through Blackboard.  My general rule is that I provide feedback **once** on all material.
