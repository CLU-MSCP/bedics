These guidelines help me to help you in taking the next step in your career.  Please let me know if you need any accommodations to the below preferences. 

1. [Letters of Recommendation](#lor)
2. [Prospective Programs](#programs)
3. [Professional Material](#material)


### 1. Letters of Recommendation (LOR) {#lor}

  
**Get Organized (Doctoral/Internship)** – The application process requires a great deal of organization. An ideal situation is for you to _share_ with me (not email me) a Google Sheet that lists all your schools, their deadlines, and whether or not you received a confirmation email that I submitted the LOR. I could then see what I’m missing. Here’s a doctoral example for a spreadsheet:

</center> 
 
You could add more information to share with me such as the admission ratio, average GREs for admission, or other tasks that help you keep track of what you need (i.e., submitted transcripts etc.). Revise this to fit your needs.

**Due Dates (Doctoral/Internship)** – You should submit all your LOR requests 1-month before each deadline. Anything less than 1-month is risky and so you should have your list early and resist the urge to make late additions.  

**Electronic Submissions (Doctoral)** – The best and easiest way for me to submit letters is through an online web portal that is sent to me via email from the university. Students can sometimes lack clarity on how to submit for each school. Please do your research. Related:

    a. **No Snail Mail** – I do not send enveloped mail to universities. Check to see if any of your schools require actual physical letters. You will need to provide me with a stamped, addressed envelope with no return address. Please discuss with me.
  
    b.	**LOR to Student** – I do not send letters directly for you to disperse at your choosing. That does not happen. You’ll have to drop the school or me. You pick.

### 2. Prospective Programs {#programs}

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of admission is to apply broadly across a number of criteria.  As noted above in the Excel, typical criteria include:

  * Applicant/Acceptance Ratio
  * Average or Minimum GRE Scores
  * Average or Minimum GPA
  * Faculty Fit (PHD Programs)
  * School Mission Fit (PSYD Programs)  
  * Funding Available (Full or Partial Tuition Remission and/or Stipends)

Do what you can do quantify the above factors and fit them into your Excel. You can then do your best to assess the diversity of your options. Try to assign them to tiers based on your own personal sorting.  Lastly, make sure you have representation in all tiers.  In my experience, students either severely overestimate or underestimate themselves. Such a ranking can help see where you might have holes.

You should also consider programs outside of clinical psychology PHD or PSYD. Examine programs in the following areas:

  * Education Psychology
  * Counseling Psychology
  * PHD in Social work or MFT
  * Public Health

They programs will likely have greater odds of admission while at the same time providing some funding if you stick to large state schools.  Many students perceive these programs as "less than" PHD Clinical Psychology programs and that's just not true.  It's about fit.  I do recommend, however, trying your best to only include universities that traditional colleges and universities rather than free standing programs.

### 3. Professional Material {#material}

Feel free to share with me your personal statement, CVs, or other material on a Google Drive preferably where you shared your Google Sheet.  I provided example CVs and an excellent personal statement for doctoral programs in the MS Clinical folder. You can access the folder through Blackboard.  My general rule is that I provide feedback **once** on all material.
