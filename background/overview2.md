## Everything you want to know about statistics (well, sort of)
#### **Everything you need to know *and more* from DSUR**

The chapter continues the discussion of building statistical models through a discussion of sampling from populations, error and noise in the data, and model fitting.  

### Key Terms

Several key terms to be familiar with including the following:

- [Confidence Intervals](#intervals)
- [Effect Sizes](#effects)
- [Statistical Power](#power)

Each of these concepts are critical in preparing to conduct a study and in the post-publication evaluation of a study. A few critical take home points from this section:

1. Prior to conducting your study, ask yourself this question: "In the area that I'm studying, what are the typical **effect sizes** that I would expect to see in my study?"
    * A good researcher would review the literature, meta-analyses, etc. and document where they found the expected effects. 

2. Prior to conducting your study, **conduct a power analysis** using the expected effect size from the literature reviewed to determine your sample size for *each* of your hypotheses.
    * If you wanted to be conservative, calculate power based on an effect size smaller than what was estimated.  Many researchers, in fact, calculate power for multiple effect sizes.

3. If, at any point, you say to yourself that you **"needed more participants"** than you should really ask yourself "Why did I even bother doing this study?"  
    * Problem 1: Why conduct a study if you were unlikely to detect an effect? 
    * Problem 2: You could have, or might actually have, other results that are statistically significant.  Do you now trust them b/c they were significant?  The logic fails. These significant results are potentially equally unreliable if you had <strong>no business</strong> finding those results in the first place! (i.e., our false positives)

These solutions are pretty clear:  
      
      1. Know your expected effect sizes.
      2. Conduct a power analysis on a range of effect sizes (including conservative small effects) to determine your sample size
      3. Pre-register your hypotheses and methods 
      4. Focus on replication in your work.
