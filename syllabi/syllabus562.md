## COURSE DESCRIPTION {#course}

The course provides in-depth coverage of the scientific process and scientific values as it relates to the application of statistical modeling.  The course will emphasize statistical thinking over statistical ritual as students will be introduced to critical topics in psychological science including theory-testing, reproducibility, statistical power, and the philosophical underpinnings of null-hypothesis statistical testing.  The course will also provide coverage of the more commonly used statistical procedures in psychological research.  These procedures include correlation, multiple regression, logistic regression, and multi-level regression.  Students will learn how to conduct these procedures and interpret statistical results using the free, open source software environment called R. The skills you learn in this class should prepare you to better consumers and producers of research in the sciences.    
Students who have satisfactorily completed this course should be able to: 

  * Develop a research workflow that is supportive of the scientific values of reproducibility,
    transparency, and collaboration.
    
  * Organize a dataset for the purposes of statistical analysis by developing skills for importing     data and data wrangling (munging). 
    
  * Create effective plots and figures to visually demonstrate the general trends, variations, and     associations in any given dataset.
    
  * Conduct and analyze linear and logistic regression models in R. 
    
  * Assess and address the assumptions of common statistical procedures used in psychological         research including linear and logistic regressions.  
    
  * Use R, R Studio, Git, Github and additional Git Clients to effectively manage research            workflow and work collaboratively with a peer on a data science project. 
    
  * Create and communicate results from a data science project using R Markdown and R                 Presentations.
