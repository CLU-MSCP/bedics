## COURSE DESCRIPTION {#course}

The course provides in-depth coverage of the scientific process and scientific values as it relates to the application of statistical modeling.  The course will emphasize statistical thinking over statistical ritual as students will be introduced to critical topics in psychological science including theory-testing, reproducibility, statistical power, and the philosophical underpinnings of null-hypothesis statistical testing.  The course will also provide coverage of the more commonly used statistical procedures in psychological research.  These procedures include correlation, multiple regression, logistic regression, and multi-level regression.  Students will learn how to conduct these procedures and interpret statistical results using the free, open source software environment called R. The skills you learn in this class should prepare you to better consumers and producers of research in the sciences.    
Students who have satisfactorily completed this course should be able to: 

    Develop a research workflow that is supportive of the scientific values of reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration.
    
    Organize a dataset for the purposes of statistical analysis by developing skills for importing data and data wrangling (munging). 
    
    Create effective plots and figures to visually demonstrate the general trends, variations, and associations in any given dataset.
    
    Conduct and analyze linear and logistic regression models in R. 
    
    Assess and address the assumptions of common statistical procedures used in psychological research including linear and logistic regressions.  
    
    Use R, R Studio, Git, Github and additional Git Clients to effectively manage research workflow and work collaboratively with a peer on a data science project. 
    
    Create and communicate results from a data science project using R Markdown and R Presentations.

## Slack versus Email {#slack}
Slack (Searchable Log for All Conversation and Knowledge) is cloud-based application for teamwork and collaboration.  Slack is widely used within a variety of industries especially those that are more technology focused.  Slack is organized by topic and allows you to ask questions about any assignments, projects, and/or course materials.  The course instructor and TAs are on Slack to answer any questions.  You can direct message people through Slack but the goal is to ask a question for the entire class to see so we all can learn.  You will be emailed an invite.

			

## Assignments and Grading {#assignments}

1. Weekly Class Readings and Weekly R HW Assignment (30%) - These are practical, hands-on, activities to build your skill in R and Git. Many of these exercises are repetitive and build on each other as we progress through the course.

      reading.rmd - Make an R Script for every week that you have reading.  In your reading most,       if not all, of the code provided as examples will be reproducible from data within the            package itself.  Only for DSUR will you have to import data. There is no requirement for          exact content.  I want to see you practice and watch how you discuss code. Create two files       for each book:
          o	r4ds.Rmd
          o	dsur.Rmd

      hw.rmd - Make an R Script for every weekly homework.  In your reading most, if not all, of the code provided as examples will be reproducible from data within the package itself.  Only for DSUR will you have to import data.  Create one file: 
      
      562hw.Rmd

The three R markdown files should be in uploaded to your cloned GitHub Repo ("firstname_lastname") which you should be linked to a R Project via Git. Make your revisions locally and then do your Git thing (knit, pull, commit, push, make an issue) within RStudio.  Do this forever. 

2. Weekly "Flash Card" Assignment (10%) - Each week you will be learning a variety of terms and definitions related to R and Statistics.  Come prepared with at least three flash cards similar to those in the handouts folder on the Google Drive from Chris Albon. I prefer that they're "physical flashcards."  You can scan them and upload them in a folder in your GitHub Repo or simply show me then in class.  I prefer the former with a "readme.txt" that lists all the cards.   

3. Mid-Term Concepts Exam (20%) - A midterm concept exam will test your working memory of the many functions and statistical concepts learned during the first half of the course. 

4. Final Group Project and Collaboration (20%) - You and a partner will work collaboratively with the instructor or the TA to develop reproducible workflow for a data analysis project of interest to you.   You will either scrape or import data from the internet or clone a GitHub repository of interest.  Using the archived data, you'll will address issues of data wrangling, summarizing, visualization, modeling, and communication and presentation.  You will be assigned a partner to work with collaboratively on two separate projects. Each student will have primary responsibility for their own topic. Provide feedback to a peers regarding their presentations by December 10th.  
        a.	Submit a `.Rmd` file. Commit, Push, and make an Issue on GitHub
        b.	Submit a `.Rpres` file.  Commit, Push, and make an Issue on GitHub
        c.	Give a peer feedback and rate your peer.

5. Final Concepts Exam (20%) - It's like the mid-term but for the material in the second half of the course only.
