## Course Description & Goals {#course}

Course Description: Applied knowledge base and research skills necessary for successful completion of a thesis or independent research project. Requires completion of the IRB, introduction, method, reference sections and pre-registration.  Prerequisites: PSYC 564.
 
Course Goals: The main purpose of this course is for you to develop an independent research project that could be used to fulfill the requirements for the thesis.  In doing so you will be able to: 

  * Think scientifically about behavior and mental processes related to your personal interests and research questions.

  * Review, critique, and summarize results of scientific inquiries published in psychological journals.

  * Develop testable research hypotheses derived from theory.
  
  * Consider the use of a wide variety of research methods, designs, and statistics to test your proposed research hypotheses.
  
  * Speak and write effectively in the discourse of the discipline in order to communicate effectively with others in the profession.
  
  * Create a reproducible research project that can be shared with the scientific community.
  
  * Pre-register a research project consistent with the scientific values of openness, transparency, and integrity.

## Assignments and Grading {#assignments}

The major assignments all represent important milestones leading to the successful completion of your thesis.  Each major assignment will be uploaded and accessed through [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) where multiple versions are kept stored. If you have not already, join OSF with your CLU email and send Dr. Bedics your userid.  You will be invited to join the PSYC565 homepage.  Follow the instructions on the homepage.  

1.	**Christensen Article Outline** - The Christensen article is an example of a clearly written, well-outlined research paper. Follow the "Outline Example" handout on the Google Drive and review the Christensen article. 

2.	**Paper Outline with Measures** - Create a proposed outline for your literature review.  Identify the relevant constructs and how they are to be measured.  List all the measures on a sheet of paper and include the reference where they can be found.  Note the reliability and validity cited for the measures 

3.	**Committee Member Assignment** - The committee consists of two people minimum.  All committee members must be approved by Dr. Bedics.  Committee members will provide important feedback on your work and, ultimately, pass, pass with revisions or fail the thesis.  One person acts as chair and the other(s) as a reader.  No more than three people can serve on the committee.  One person on the committee must be faculty from CLU.  The CLU faculty does not have to be the chair.  The chair takes the lead and acts as a major advisor/supervisor  of your work. Selection of appropriate committee members is critical to a quality thesis. Complete the committee member handout to fulfill this assignment.

4.	**Method and Data Analytic Plan (OSF)** - Consistent with APA style, write a method section consisting of a participants, materials, and procedure section. The data analytic plan is typically added to the end of the Method section in most journals.  It simple describes the statistical methods you plan to use to test each hypothesis. (Draft and Final)

5.	**NIH Certificate (OSF)** - Everyone in the class will complete a NIH certificate training program.  Complete the training and save the certificate to your computer.  Email Dr. Bedics the certificate. A link to the training can be found at: http://www.callutheran.edu/irb/

6.	**Literature Review and Reference (OSF)** - The literature review will represent the bulk of your work in this class.  The literature review is meant to be exhaustive and written in APA style.  A good paper is one that thoroughly reviews the literature and tells a well-articulated story leading to your hypotheses (i.e., hypothesis validity).  This will require extensive use of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, and Medline/PubMed.  Ideally, the bulk of your literature will be recent, peer-reviewed journal articles and academic books, but mostly journal articles.  Do not include reviews of dissertations. The final paper will also include an updated and complete reference list.  The introduction, without the references and abstract (etc.) is typically 15-20 pages.  (Draft and Final)

7.	**One-Page Proposal (OSF)**  - A one-page summary of your proposed project will be created to submit to your committee members.  This is a narrative of your outline and requires a developed idea, working hypotheses, and methods of measurement.  See the one-page summary handout for an example of what I am expecting.  

8.	**Institutional Review Board (IRB)** - An important part of getting your project off the ground will be the successful composition and submission of an application to the Institutional Review Board.  You can begin working on this once you have committed to an idea and have a developed proposal.  Components of this project will include completing a proposal, application, and informed consent.  Relevant documents can be found here: [CLU IRB](http://www.callutheran.edu/irb/). (Draft and Final)

9.	[**AsPredicted**](https://aspredicted.org/) Pre-Registration - AsPredicted is a verified document that details the proposed data management, data visualization, and data modeling for each of your proposed hypotheses. AsPredicted cannot be finalized until your IRB is approved.  Submit your drafts to OSF.

10.	**Professional Identification and CV** - As professionals, an important part of our job is to contribute to the larger scientific community.  The primary mechanism for doing so is through professional organizations, attendance at conferences/conventions, and publications.  This assignment will require you to identify professional communities relevant to your work as well as relevant journals that could act as an outlet for your work.  See the professional identity handout for an example of how to complete this assignment.  Complete a curriculum vita (CV) and professional identification as part of this assignment.

11.	**PSYC 562 Presentation** - Showcase your study proposal and design to the first-year MSCP students in advanced statistics.  12-minute PPT presentations.  

12.	**Weekly Classroom PowerPoint Updates** - These will be formal updates presented to your peers each week. The content you present will be unique to your personal progress and will not be the same as your peers.  What will be uniform is the structure of the presentation.  The first part will be a summary of what has been done up until this point (one or two slides), followed by a presentation of new literature, new methods, new ideas, resources or new milestones accomplished.  The final section will list next steps for the project. Be sure, however, to include accomplishments such as identifying committee members, completing the "professional identification assignment," etc.  In addition, for particular assignments you will read each other's work and give feedback.  Peer feedback is secondary to Dr. Bedics' but it teaches an important skillset in terms of reading and how to provide effective feedback (i.e., precise, accurate, factual, and supportive).  Please keep note of weekly assignments as there are many.  All are listed in course schedule.

13.	**Peer Reviews and Writing Center** - You will review your peers work throughout the semester and provide feedback.  Students will review one peer's literature review, method, one-page proposal, AsPredicted, R Code, and IRB.  Students will also go to the writing center to get feedback on a draft of their literature review.  

14.	**R Code** - Submit your proposed R code for your entire project.  You will have to conduct power analysis, data wrangling (munging), data visualization, and modeling.  The code should be well organized and include comments.  The code should also be able to run with mock data.

1. **Weekly Class Readings and Weekly R HW Assignment** (30%) - These are practical, hands-on, activities to build your skill in R and Git. Many of these exercises are repetitive and build on each other as we progress through the course.

      reading.rmd - Make an R Script for every week that you have reading.  In your reading most,       if not all, of the code provided as examples will be reproducible from data within the            package itself.  Only for DSUR will you have to import data. There is no requirement for          exact content.  I want to see you practice and watch how you discuss code. Create two files       for each book:
          o	r4ds.Rmd
          o	dsur.Rmd

      hw.rmd - Make an R Script for every weekly homework.  In your reading most, if not all, of the code provided as examples will be reproducible from data within the package itself.  Only for DSUR will you have to import data.  Create one file: 
      
      562hw.Rmd

The three R markdown files should be in uploaded to your cloned GitHub Repo ("firstname_lastname") which you should be linked to a R Project via Git. Make your revisions locally and then do your Git thing (knit, pull, commit, push, make an issue) within RStudio.  Do this forever. 

2. **Weekly "Flash Card" Assignment** (10%) - Each week you will be learning a variety of terms and definitions related to R and Statistics.  Come prepared with at least three flash cards similar to those in the handouts folder on the Google Drive from Chris Albon. I prefer that they're "physical flashcards."  You can scan them and upload them in a folder in your GitHub Repo or simply show me then in class.  I prefer the former with a "readme.txt" that lists all the cards.   

3. **Mid-Term Concepts Exam** (20%) - A midterm concept exam will test your working memory of the many functions and statistical concepts learned during the first half of the course. 

4. **Final Group Project and Collaboration** (20%) - You and a partner will work collaboratively with the instructor or the TA to develop reproducible workflow for a data analysis project of interest to you.   You will either scrape or import data from the internet or clone a GitHub repository of interest.  Using the archived data, you'll will address issues of data wrangling, summarizing, visualization, modeling, and communication and presentation.  You will be assigned a partner to work with collaboratively on two separate projects. Each student will have primary responsibility for their own topic. Provide feedback to a peers regarding their presentations by December 10th.  
        a.	Submit a `.Rmd` file. Commit, Push, and make an Issue on GitHub
        b.	Submit a `.Rpres` file.  Commit, Push, and make an Issue on GitHub
        c.	Give a peer feedback and rate your peer.

5. **Final Concepts Exam** (20%) - It's like the mid-term but for the material in the second half of the course only.
