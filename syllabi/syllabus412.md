## Course Description & Objectives {#course}

The goals of this course will serve as an overview of advanced methodological issues in psychological research. Students will be encouraged to think critically about their own research, advanced topics in psychological science and how to apply these principles to their own proposed research project.  

The course is designed to familiarize students with all aspects of psychological research including, but not limited to the following:

  *	Understanding the principles of open science including the importance of collaboration and transparency through the sharing of materials and data as well as pre-registration of studies. 
  
  *	Appreciate the importance of replication as an undervalued and yet critical component for the accumulation of knowledge in psychological research.  

  *	Learn the technological tools that allow for researchers to conduct reproducible research consistent with good science in psychology.   

  *	Gain a basic competency and familiarity with the R statistical programming language for data wrangling, data visualization, and statistical modeling.

  *	How to put the principles of open science into action by conducting a pre-registered, reproducible, replication study using R, R Projects, and the Open Science Framework.

  * Continued training in methods for improving statistical analyses with an emphasis on regression.  

PROGRAM COMPETENCIES ASSESSED IN THIS COURSE

## Assignments and Grading {#assignments}

1.	**Advanced Methods Articles for an Improved Psychological Science** (10%) - In this class, a priority is for you to understand how to conduct better psychological research.  In order to do that, you need to be familiar with the contemporary issues. The articles are dense and will be time-consuming.  Please adjust your time appropriately. 

    * Complete 10/14 Reflections on any of the articles of your choosing.  Write a 1-2 (max), typed, double-spaced summary of the main points along with 1-question for the article. Each article is due on the date assigned.  In other words, if you skip the first 4 then you must do the last 10.  You'll be rated on your thoughtfulness and understanding of the entire article (10 points each article).

    * All assignments are due at the beginning of class.  Never email an assignment to the instructor.  

2.	**Registered Replication and Reproducible Research Project** (50%) - The ability to replicate and extend prior work is critical for psychology as a science.  You will write-up a replication study of an article of your choice.  
  
    * Introduction Section (15%) - Write a brief four-page introduction section (in APA Style).  
  
        * Part 1. Provide an overview of the problem (first paragraph)
  
        * Part 2. Review the article you're replicating. (2-3 paragraphs)
  
        * Part 3. Discuss 1-2 new articles related to the research (1-2 paragraphs)
  
        * Part 4. Discuss the importance of replication in science (1-paragraph)
  
        * Part 5. Hypotheses (should be exact or even improved for direct replication; i.e., Class 1 from Schmidt, 2009).

    * Method Section (5%) - Write a proposed method section (in APA style) that includes the participants, measures, procedures, and data analysis.

    * R Code (25%) - In this section, you are to create R code that will do the following:
    
      * Import data into the R Project
    
      * Reverse all necessary scores on the measures that need reversing.
     
      * Summarize all the necessary scores need to conduct your analyses.
    
      * Provide a power analysis for each hypothesis.
    
      * Create at least two graphs.
    
      * Write proposed analyses for at least one hypothesis
    
      * Create simulated data - Create a simulated database with mock data that can be used to run your R code. 
    
      * Have everything work :)
    
    * Pre-Registration (5%) - Complete the pre-registration process through OSF or AsPredicted.


3. **Midterm Exam** (15%) - A multiple-choice and short-answer mid-term will cover all of the readings (textbook and articles) during the first part of the class. A review sheet will be provided!

4. **Final Exam** (15%) - A multiple-choice and short-answer final exam will cover all of the readings (textbook and articles) from the second part of the class. A review sheet will be provided!

5. **DSUR Assignments** (8%) - An important part of this course is gaining some familiarity with the R programming language.  We will cover enough chapters in the DSUR textbook to get you familiar with running several statistical analyses in R.  An important part of learning R is practice, practice, practice.  You will complete questions at the end of the chapter and a total of 7 in-class practice assignments.
