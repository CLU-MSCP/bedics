## COURSE DESCRIPTION 

The course provides an introduction to the basic concepts and applications of hierarchical linear models. Research data in the social sciences are often grouped in ways that impact our statistical analyses (e.g., marital status, school/clinic/hospital setting, repeated treatment sessions). The course will cover growth curve modeling, and meta-analysis as well as introduce models for dichotomous outcomes. The objective of the course is that students will be to understand when and why hierarchical linear models should be used and effectively apply them to a wide variety of situations.
